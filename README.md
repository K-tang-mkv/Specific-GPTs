ðŸš€ Apart from the general language model (LLM), we also need more specific GPTs to assist us in handling downstream tasks or driving industry development.

### [roomGPT](https://github.com/Nutlope/roomGPT) - redesign your room with AI
It uses an ML model called [ControlNet](https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet) to generate variations of rooms. This application gives you the ability to upload a photo of any room, which will send it through this ML Model using a Next.js API route, and return your generated room. The ML Model is hosted on Replicate and Upload is used for image storage.
